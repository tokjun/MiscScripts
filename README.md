## dicom_split.sh

This scirpt demonstrates how to separate DICOM files based on Tag (0008,0008). It checks the types of images (either magnitude or phase) and copy them to sub-folders depending on their types (either MAG/ or PH/). Once it copies all the files to the sub-folders, it rename and move the sub-folders to the upper level.
